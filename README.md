# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of Project
#### The purpose of this project is to assist Pewlett-Hackard with the large number of retiring employees. We used PostgreSQL to query the retiring employees by title. Then we created a query to determine the employees that could become part of a mentorship program for the new hires that will be replacing the retiring employees. The criteria for the mentorship program is current employees born in 1965.
## Results

* The department with the highest number of retirees is the Engineering Department. The total number eligible for retirement is 45,397 employees
  * Senior Engineers: 29,414
  * Engineers: 14,222
  * Assistant Engineer: 1,761
  
* The total number of retirees is 90,398

* The number of employees eligible for the mentorship program is 1,549

* There are 2 manager's retiring, but no manager's are eligible for the mentorship program

## Summary
Because Pewlett Hackard has so many employees nearing retirement age, they need to start replacing employees. The list for the mentorship program will cover all of the titles that will need to be replaced except for Managers. They need to make exceptions to the birth year to include at least one manager in the mentorship program.
